# How to open Pluto Notebooks

To open a Pluto Notebook you need to have a working Julia Version installed on your Computer. If you have not download one here https://julialang.org/downloads/

Open a Julia command-line in your Terminal. Then execute the following

    imoprt Pkg; Pkg.add("Pluto")
   
then
 
    using Pluto
  
and finally
  
     Pluto.run()
     
If everything worked out you should be redirected automatically to your standard browser where you see the Pluto Mangager Page. To open one of the Notebooks from this repository copy the link of the file and past it into the "Open from file"-Textfield and click Open. Enjoy!
